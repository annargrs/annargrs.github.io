<p>I am an Associate Professor in the <a href="https://en.itu.dk/Research/Departments/Computer-Science-Department">Computer Science Department</a> at the IT University of Copenhagen. My main research area is Natural Language Processing, in particular analysis and evaluation of pre-trained language models. I was a co-program-chair of <a href="https://2023.aclweb.org/committees/organization/">the 61st Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL 2023)</a>.</p>

<p>Before moving to Denmark, I was a postdoc in the University of Massachusetts, working on sentiment analysis, question answering and analysis of Transformer-based language models. Then I joined the <a href="https://sodas.ku.dk/">Center for Social Data Science</a> at the University of Copenhagen, focusing on AI and society (as a postdoc and later assistant professor). I hold a Ph.D. degree from the <a href="https://www.c.u-tokyo.ac.jp/eng_site/info/academics/grad/lis/">Department of Language and Information Sciences</a> at the University of Tokyo (Japan).</p>
