I am a post-doctoral associate at the University of Copenhagen, working with the research groups in the [Center for Social Data Science](https://sodas.ku.dk/) and [Machine Learning section](https://di.ku.dk/english/research/groups/nlp/). My main research area is Natural Language Processing. I work on interpretability and evaluation of deep learning models, as well as computational social science.

Before moving to Denmark, I was a postdoctoral research associate in the University of Massachusetts, working with [Anna Rumshisky](http://text-machine.cs.uml.edu/) on sentiment analysis, temporal annotation, question answering and analysis of meaning representations. I hold a Ph.D. degree from the [Department of Language and Information Sciences](https://www.c.u-tokyo.ac.jp/eng_site/info/academics/grad/lis/) at the University of Tokyo (Japan).

This year I co-organize the [Workshop on Insights From Negative Results in NLP](https://insights-workshop.github.io), and serve as publicity chair for [EMNLP](https://2020.emnlp.org/) and [COLING 2020](https://coling2020.org/). I write the [Hacking Semantics Blog](https://hackingsemantics.xyz/), and am active on [#NLProc Twitter](https://twitter.com/annargrs).
