<p>The NLP systems based on large language models are increasingly deployed in many real-world applications, and have real impact on the lives on many people. However, we still do not have reliable methods to explain the ‘reasoning’ backing their outputs, and many current systems also lack even the minimal transparency about their design and training data.</p>

<p>My current work in this area is backed by 2024 Villum Young Investigator grant (see <a href="#phd-and-postdoc-positions">upcoming positions</a>). It focuses on the problem of attribution of the output of generative language models to their training data.

This work proposes an approach to global language data governance that attempts to organize data management amongst stakeholders, values, and rights. Our proposal is informed by prior work on distributed governance that accounts for human values and grounded by an international research collaboration that brings together researchers and practitioners from 60 countries. The framework we present is a multi-party international governance structure focused on language data, and incorporating technical and organizational tools needed to support its work.</div>

While automatic metrics allow for quick benchmarking, it isn’t clear how such metrics reflect human interaction with explanations. Human evaluation is of paramount importance, but previous protocols fail to account for belief biases affecting human performance, which may lead to misleading conclusions. We provide an overview of belief bias, its role in human evaluation, and ideas for NLP practitioners on how to account for it. For two experimental paradigms, we present a case study of gradient-based explainability introducing simple ways to account for humans’ prior beliefs: models of varying quality and adversarial examples. We show that conclusions about the highest performing methods change when introducing such controls, pointing to the importance of accounting for belief bias in evaluation.</div>

    <div class="abstract" id="KovalevaKulshreshthaEtAl_2021_BERT_Busters_abs">Multiple studies have shown that Transformers are remarkably robust to pruning. Contrary to this received wisdom, we demonstrate that pre-trained Transformer encoders are surprisingly fragile to the removal of a very small number of features in the layer outputs (&lt;0.0001% of model weights). In case of BERT and other pre-trained encoder Transformers, the affected component is the scaling factors and biases in the LayerNorm. The outliers are high-magnitude normalization parameters that emerge early in pre-training and show up consistently in the same dimensional position throughout the model. We show that disabling them significantly degrades both the MLM loss and the downstream task performance. This effect is observed across several BERT-family models and other popular pre-trained Transformer architectures, including BART, XLNet and ELECTRA; we also show a similar effect in GPT-2.</div>

In the current work, we focus on the interpretation of self-attention, which is one of the fundamental underlying components of BERT. Using a subset of GLUE tasks and a set of handcrafted features-of-interest, we propose the methodology and carry out a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the information encoded by the individual BERT’s heads. Our findings suggest that there is a limited set of attention patterns that are repeated across different heads, indicating the overall model overparametrization. While different heads consistently use the same attention patterns, they have varying impact on performance across different tasks. We show that manually disabling attention in certain heads leads to a performance improvement over the regular fine-tuned BERT models.</div>

<h2 id="safe-and-robust-nlp">Safe and Robust NLP</h2>

<p>I use “safety” in the engineering sense of the word: the NLP systems should actually do what their developers are promising, the same way as e.g. construction engineers ensure that the bridges they build withstand the target load. This is inextricably linked to the topic of robustness of generalization: the NLP systems are trained on some data, and to perform in the real world they need to generalize to the real-world data.</p>

<p>My current work in this area is backed by 2023 DFF Inge Lehmann grant (see <a href="#phd-and-postdoc-positions">upcoming positions</a>). It focuses on the development of a benchmark that would reward systems for generalizing rather than memorizing their training data.

    <div class="abstract" id="puccetti2024ainewscontentfarms_abs">Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as ‘content farm’ models (CFMs), to generate synthetic text that could pass for real news articles. This is already happening even for languages that do not have high-quality monolingual LLMs. We show that fine-tuning Llama (v1), mostly trained on English, on as little as 40K Italian news articles, is sufficient for producing news-like texts that native speakers of Italian struggle to identify as synthetic.We investigate three LLMs and three methods of detecting synthetic texts (log-likelihood, DetectGPT, and supervised classification), finding that they all perform better than human raters, but they are all impractical in the real world (requiring either access to token likelihood information or a large dataset of CFM texts). We also explore the possibility of creating a proxy CFM: an LLM fine-tuned on a similar dataset to one used by the real ‘content farm’. We find that even a small amount of fine-tuning data suffices for creating a successful detector, but we need to know which base LLM is used, which is a major challenge.Our results suggest that there are currently no practical methods for detecting synthetic news-like texts ‘in the wild’, while generating them is too easy. We highlight the urgency of more NLP research on this problem.</div>

    <div class="abstract" id="KuznetsovAfzalEtAl_2024_What_Can_abs">The number of scientific articles produced every year is growing rapidly. Providing quality control over them is crucial for scientists and, ultimately, for the public good. In modern science, this process is largely delegated to peer review – a distributed procedure in which each submission is evaluated by several independent experts in the field. Peer review is widely used, yet it is hard, time-consuming, and prone to error. Since the artifacts involved in peer review – manuscripts, reviews, discussions – are largely text-based, Natural Language Processing has great potential to improve reviewing. As the emergence of large language models (LLMs) has enabled NLP assistance for many new tasks, the discussion on machine-assisted peer review is picking up the pace. Yet, where exactly is help needed, where can NLP help, and where should it stand aside? The goal of our paper is to provide a foundation for the future efforts in NLP for peer-reviewing assistance. We discuss peer review as a general process, exemplified by reviewing at AI conferences. We detail each step of the process from manuscript submission to camera-ready revision, and discuss the associated challenges and opportunities for NLP assistance, illustrated by existing work. We then turn to the big challenges in NLP for peer review as a whole, including data acquisition and licensing, operationalization and experimentation, and ethical issues. To help consolidate community efforts, we create a companion repository that aggregates key datasets pertaining to peer review. Finally, we issue a detailed call for action for the scientific community, NLP and AI researchers, policymakers, and funding bodies to help bring the research in NLP for peer review forward. We hope that our work will help set the agenda for research in machine-assisted scientific quality control in the age of AI, within the NLP community and beyond.</div>

Question answering and reading comprehension have been particularly prolific in this regard, with over 80 new datasets appearing in the past two years. This study is the largest survey of the field to date. We provide an overview of the various formats and domains of the current resources, highlighting the current lacunae for future work. We further discuss the current classifications of “reasoning types" in question answering and propose a new taxonomy. We also discuss the implications of over-focusing on English, and survey the current monolingual resources for other languages and multilingual resources. The study is aimed at both practitioners looking for pointers to the wealth of existing data, and at researchers working on new resources.</div>

    learning-based models score highly on NLU benchmarks for the ’right’ reasons; and (b) what those reasons would even be.
    We investigate the behavior of reading comprehension models with respect to two linguistic ’skills’:
    coreference resolution and comparison. We propose a definition for the reasoning steps expected from a system that would be ’reading slowly’,
    and compare that with the behavior of five models of the BERT family of various sizes, observed through saliency scores and counterfactual explanations.
    We find that for comparison (but not coreference) the systems based on larger encoders are more likely to rely on the ’right’ information, but even
    they struggle with generalization, suggesting that they still learn specific lexical patterns rather than the general principles of comparison.</div>

    <div class="abstract" id="RogersKovalevaEtAl_2020_Getting_Closer_abs">The recent explosion in question answering research produced a wealth of both factoid RC and commonsense reasoning datasets. Combining them presents a different kind of task: not deciding simply whether information is present in the text, but also whether a confident guess could be made for the missing information. To that end, we present QuAIL, the first reading comprehension dataset (a) to combine textbased, world knowledge and unanswerable questions, and (b) to provide annotation that would enable precise diagnostics of the reasoning strategies by a given QA system. QuAIL contains 15K multi-choice questions for 800 texts in 4 domains (fiction, blogs, political news, and user story texts). Crucially, to solve QuAIL a system would need to handle both general and text-specific questions, impossible to answer from pretraining data. We show that the new benchmark poses substantial challenges to the current state-of-the-art systems, with a 30% drop in accuracy compared to the most similar existing dataset.</div>

However, these models have been shown to be reducible to a smaller number of self-attention heads and layers. We consider this phenomenon from the perspective of the lottery ticket hypothesis. For fine-tuned BERT, we show that (a) it is possible to find a subnetwork of elements that achieves performance comparable with that of the full model, and (b) similarly-sized subnetworks sampled from the rest of the model perform worse. However, the "bad" subnetworks can be fine-tuned separately to achieve only slightly worse performance than the "good" ones, indicating that most weights in the pre-trained BERT are potentially useful. We also show that the "good" subnetworks vary considerably across GLUE tasks, opening up the possibilities to learn what knowledge BERT actually uses at inference time.</div>

  <li>Generally, to be enrolled in the Ph.D. school in Denmark, you need to have a Master’s degree.</li>
  <li>The PhD in Denmark is fixed-term (3 years). It is possible to take breaks to go on internships.</li>
  <li>The Danish visa process for non-EU citizens usually takes about 3 months (after you receive and accept the offer).</li>
  <li>You <em>don’t</em> have to learn Danish, either for professional or everyday life.</li>

<div class="bla">
<p>If you’re a B.Sc. or M.Sc. student at IT University of Copenhagen, and you would like to work with me, please:</p>

<ul>
  <li>reach out stating <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[ITU M.Sc. thesis]</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[ITU B.Sc. thesis]</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[ITU research project]</code> at the start of the subject.</li>
  <li>introduce yourself and state:
    <ul>
      <li>the topic(s) that could be in our shared interests (see mine below)</li>
      <li>your background and any <strong>relevant experience</strong>. For an NLP project, you would ideally have taken an NLP course (even online or self-taught), or you have hands-on experience with the subject matter relevant to your preferred topic.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Here are some of the research directions that I would be interested in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Language model analysis</strong>: identifying the types of knowledge acquired from language model pre-training.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Language processing strategies</strong>: do NLP models perform well for the right reasons? What strategies should they follow when solving reasoning tasks?</li>
  <li>
<strong>Robustness and generalization</strong>: do NLP models reliably perform their tasks out of training distribution, and what can we do to help them?</li>
  <li>
<strong>NLP system auditing and documentation</strong>: establishing the cases where a system is safe to deploy</li>
  <li>
<strong>NLP system interpretability</strong>: how can we establish how a deep learning model arrives at its decisions?</li>
  <li>
<strong>Sustainable NLP</strong>: how can we build systems that work well, but don’t require billions of parameters and terabytes of data?</li>
</ul>

<p>Feel free to also look at my recent <a href="/publications">publications</a> and see if there’s anything you’d like to build on.</p>
