We do this by drawing on a comprehensive registry dataset, which is available for Denmark across several years, and that includes information about life-events related to health, education, occupation, income, address and working hours, recorded with day-to-day resolution. We create embeddings of life-events in a single vector space, showing that this embedding space is robust and highly structured. Our models allow us to predict diverse outcomes ranging from early mortality to personality nuances, outperforming state-of-the-art models by a wide margin. Using methods for interpreting deep learning models, we probe the algorithm to understand the factors that enable our predictions. Our framework allows researchers to discover potential mechanisms that impact life outcomes as well as the associated possibilities for personalized interventions.",

We present analysis of the factors affecting peer review, identify the most problematic issues that the authors complained about, and provide suggestions for the future chairs. We hope that publishing such reports would (a) improve transparency in decision-making, (b) help the people new to the field to understand how the *ACL conferences work, (c) provide useful data for the future chairs and workshop organizers, and also academic work on peer review, and (d) provide useful context for the final program, as a source of information for meta-research on the structure and trajectory of the field of NLP."

While these capabilities have led to widespread adoption, most LLMs are developed by resource-rich organizations and are frequently kept from the public. As a step towards democratizing this powerful technology, we present BLOOM, a 176B-parameter open-access language model designed and built thanks to a collaboration of hundreds of researchers. BLOOM is a decoder-only Transformer language model that was trained on the ROOTS corpus, a dataset comprising hundreds of sources in 46 natural and 13 programming languages (59 in total). We find that BLOOM achieves competitive performance on a wide variety of benchmarks, with stronger results after undergoing multitask prompted finetuning. To facilitate future research and applications using LLMs, we publicly release our models and code under the Responsible AI License.},

This paper documents the data creation and curation efforts undertaken by BigScience to assemble the Responsible Open-science Open-collaboration Text Sources (ROOTS) corpus, a 1.6TB dataset spanning 59 languages that was used to train the 176-billion-parameter BigScience Large Open-science Open-access Multilingual (BLOOM) language model. We further release a large initial subset of the corpus and analyses thereof, and hope to empower large-scale monolingual and multilingual modeling projects with both the data and the processing tools, as well as stimulate research around this large multilingual corpus.}

    We investigate the behavior of reading comprehension models with respect to two linguistic 'skills':
    coreference resolution and comparison. We propose a definition for the reasoning steps expected from a system that would be 'reading slowly',
    and compare that with the behavior of five models of the BERT family of various sizes, observed through saliency scores and counterfactual explanations.
    We find that for comparison (but not coreference) the systems based on larger encoders are more likely to rely on the 'right' information, but even
    they struggle with generalization, suggesting that they still learn specific lexical patterns rather than the general principles of comparison.},

  layers that consistently have unusual magnitude in the same dimension across the model, and significantly degrade its performance if disabled.
  We replicate the evidence for the outlier phenomenon and we link it to the geometry of the embedding space. Our main finding is that in both BERT and RoBERTa
  the token frequency, known to contribute to anisotropicity, also contributes to the outlier phenomenon. In its turn, the outlier phenomenon contributes to the
  'vertical' self-attention pattern that enables the model to focus on the special tokens. We also find that, surprisingly, the outlier effect on the model
   performance varies by layer, and that variance is also related to the correlation between outlier magnitude and encoded token frequency.}

We provide an overview of belief bias, its role in human evaluation, and ideas for NLP practitioners on how to account for it. For two experimental paradigms, we present a case study of gradient-based explainability introducing simple ways to account for humans' prior beliefs: models of varying quality and adversarial examples.

In case of BERT and other pre-trained encoder Transformers, the affected component is the scaling factors and biases in the LayerNorm. The outliers are high-magnitude normalization parameters that emerge early in pre-training and show up consistently in the same dimensional position throughout the model. We show that disabling them significantly degrades both the MLM loss and the downstream task performance.

However, the "bad" subnetworks can be fine-tuned separately to achieve only slightly worse performance than the "good" ones, indicating that most weights in the pre-trained BERT are potentially useful.

  abstract={This paper explores the possibilities of analogical reasoning with vector space models. Given two pairs of words with the same relation (e.g. man:woman :: king:queen), it was proposed that the offset between one pair of the corresponding word vectors can be used to identify the unknown member of the other pair (king - man + woman = queen). We argue against such “linguistic regularities” as a model for linguistic relations in vector space models and as a benchmark, and we show that the vector offset (as well as two other, better-performing methods) suffers from dependence on vector similarity.},

  abstract={Attempts to find a single technique for general-purpose intrinsic evaluation of word embeddings have so far not been successful. We present a new approach based on scaled-up qualitative analysis of word vector neighborhoods that quantifies interpretable characteristics of a given model (e.g. its preference for synonyms or shared morphological forms as nearest neighbors). We analyze 21 such factors and show how they correlate with performance on 14 extrinsic and intrinsic task datasets (and also explain the lack of correlation between some of them). Our approach enables multi-faceted evaluation, parameter search, and generally – a more principled, hypothesis-driven approach to development of distributional semantic representations.},

Combining them presents a different kind of task: not deciding simply whether information is present in the text, but also whether a confident guess could be made for the missing information. To that end, we present QuAIL, the first reading comprehension dataset (a) to combine textbased, world knowledge and unanswerable questions, and (b) to provide annotation that would enable precise diagnostics of the reasoning strategies by a given QA system. QuAIL contains 15K multi-choice questions for 800 texts in 4 domains (fiction, blogs, political news, and user story texts). Crucially, to solve QuAIL a system would need to handle both general and text-specific questions, impossible to answer from pretraining data. We show that the new benchmark poses substantial challenges to the current state-of-the-art systems, with a 30\% drop in accuracy compared to the most similar existing dataset.},

This method can be used to decompose a representation of an input sentence into several independent vectors, each of them responsible for a specific aspect of the input sentence. We evaluate the proposed method on two case studies: the conversion between different social registers and diachronic language change. We show that the proposed method is capable of fine-grained controlled change of these aspects of the input sentence. It is also learning a continuous (rather than categorical) representation of the style of the sentence, which is more linguistically realistic. The model uses adversarial-motivational training and includes a special motivational loss, which acts opposite to the discriminator and encourages a better decomposition. Furthermore, we evaluate the obtained meaning embeddings on a downstream task of paraphrase detection and show that they significantly outperform the embeddings of a regular autoencoder.},
