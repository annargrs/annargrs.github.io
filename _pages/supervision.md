Here are some of the possible directions for thesis and research project supervision at ITU. Feel free to get in touch if you are interested in these topics. 

- **Language model analysis**: identifying the types of knowledge acquired from language model pre-training
- **Language processing strategies**: do NLP models perform well for the right reasons? What strategies should they follow when solving reasoning tasks?
- **Robustness and generalization**: do NLP models reliably perform their tasks out of training distribution, and what can we do to help them?
- **NLP system auditing and documentation**: establishing the cases where a system is safe to deploy
- **NLP system interpretability**: how can we establish how the model arrives at its decisions?
